# NLTK-tutorial-


This will be a series of nltk tutorial from installing to feature selection and then building a machine learning 

this is form installing nltk to building a simple classifier to classify spam text 

cleaning the text which involved punctuation removal , tokenization , stemming , lemmatizer and stop words removal 

then vectorization transforming the text into numerical format for the machine learning model to use such as unigrams , bigrams , count vectorization, Inverse document frequency weighting  followed by  feature extraction building new features from the text length and percentage of punctuations and then building models RandomForest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier to train on the dataset and achieved an accuracy of 97 percent.
